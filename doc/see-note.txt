INTRODUCTION                                                *NoteIntroduction*

The inspiration for this plugin comes from a technique used in the development
of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton-Jones
explain the idea in this excerpt from The Architecture of Open Source
Applications:

  1. Comments of any significant size are not interleaved with code, but
     instead set off by themselves, with a heading in standard form.

  2. At the point where the comment is relevant, we add a short comment
     referring to the Note.

  ...

  Not only is it possible to go from the code that refers to the Note to the
  Note itself, but the reverse is also possible, and that is often useful.
  Moreover, the same Note may be referred to from multiple points in the code.

This plugin provides a thin layer of functionality supporting this idea.

CONFIGURATION                                              *NoteConfiguration*

There are three commands you will want to map:

  nmap <leader>ns :call ListNotes()<cr>
  nmap <leader>nd :call GotoNote()<cr>
  nmap <leader>nr :call FindNote()<cr>

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                              *NoteUsage*

There are two important concepts to consider:

  1. Note definition
  2. Note references

To leave a note, use the following pattern in any text file in your project:

  Note: [title of note]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A detailed explanation of the note. Perhaps in paragraphs, but maybe not.
  Really, you should just use your best judgement. Be thorough, not wordy.

To reference a note, use the following pattern in any text file in your
project:

  See: [title of note]

If you've followed the instructions in |NoteConfiguration|, then you can move
your cursor to the line containing the pattern "See: [some title]" and press
`<leader>nd` to goto the definition of that note.

If you're cursor is on the line containing "Note: [some title]" and you press
`<leader>nr`, the |quickfix| list is populated with the location of each
reference to that note. You can navigate through the list of references using
the usual |quickfix| commands `:cn` and `:cp`.

If you want a list of all note definitions, simply press `<leader>ns`. This
will populate the |quickfix| list in a manner similar to `<leader>nr`.
